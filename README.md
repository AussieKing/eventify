# User Story

As an admin user of Eventify,
I want to have the ability to create, update, and delete events,
So that I can ensure the event listings are up-to-date and relevant.

As a logged-in user,
I want to view events on Eventify,
So that I can explore and plan my attendance.

# Acceptance Criteria

The application should provide an admin interface accessible only to authorized admin users.
Upon logging in as an admin, the application should redirect me to the admin dashboard.
The admin dashboard should display a list of existing events with options to create, update, or delete events.
Creating an event should require providing relevant details such as the event title, date, time, location, description, and an optional image.
After creating an event, the application should validate the input and display appropriate error messages if any required fields are missing or invalid.
Updating an event should allow modifying any of the event details, and the changes should be reflected in the event listings.
Deleting an event should prompt for confirmation and remove the event from the system, ensuring it no longer appears in the event listings.
The application should provide a search or filtering functionality within the admin dashboard to locate specific events quickly.
The admin interface should have intuitive controls and clear instructions to perform the desired actions easily.
